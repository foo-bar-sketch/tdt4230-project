# Final Project in TDT4235

## Installation

At this moment in time the project is not compatible with windows, due to some issues with urls.

Clone the project unto your computer.

Install node and npm

When node and npm is installed, run 

```
npm install
```

to install all the node packages.

Run,
```
npm run buildDev
```

to compile the javascript into one file.

Run,
```
npm start
```
to start the server.

The demo should now be available in a browser (firefox is recommended) on the url localhost:8080.
